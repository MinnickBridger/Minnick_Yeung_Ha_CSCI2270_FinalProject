# Minnick_Yeung_Ha_CSCI2270_FinalProject
We plan on having a grocery store inventory, where we use a BST to store the products and we will also keep track of the inventory amount, price, and isle number, where the user can add products and also remove products. I am working with Eric Ha and Syrus Yeung.
