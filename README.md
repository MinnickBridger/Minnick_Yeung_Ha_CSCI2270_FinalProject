# Minnick_Yeung_Ha_CSCI2270_FinalProject
We plan on having a grocery store inventory, where we use a BST to store the products and we will also keep track of the inventory amount, price, and isle number, where the user can add products and also remove products. I am working with Eric Ha and Syrus Yeung.

Project Description:
Our project keeps track of grocery store inventory, which allows the user
to find items, print items in a certain category, print all the items in the
store, remove one item, delete all items and also allows users to add to a 
shopping cart which shows the price of the items, the cart can also be cleared.
The items in the store have a price, quantity, isle number, title and category.
We have an array of pointers to different BST's, based on their categorys.
It is similar to a hash table where there is are different categorys in 
each index, but instead of a linked list for each index it points to a BST.

How to run:
A menu will appear and display different options, which will ask for the 
user to enter a number which corresponds to a menu option. The user can select
any option however many times they wish. The program does read in a text file
titled finalGrocery.txt without that the program will not run

Dependencies:
There is none other than the finalGrocery.txt file that the program needs to
read in. Also if an error is thrown on line 50 in main about the stof go
to project -> build options and the select "Have the g++ follow the c++11 ISO
C++ language standard" then select ok. 

Requirments:
The program will run on all platforms

Known bugs/issues:
The the main.cpp file line 50 will sometimes throw an error using std::stof
if this error is thrown, go to project -> build options and then
select "Have the g++ follow the c++11 ISO C++ language standard" 
then select ok. If it still doesnt
work atoi will also work to run it, but the decimals wont be there.
